# dplace-data

Data for [D-PLACE](https://d-place.org).

Research that uses data from D-PLACE should cite both the original source(s) of
the data and the paper by Kirby et al. in which D-PLACE was first presented
e.g., for research using cultural data from the Binford Hunter-Gatherer dataset:

    Binford (2001); Binford and Johnson (2006); Kirby et al. (2016).
    
The reference list should include the *version* of the data used and URL for [D-PLACE](https://d-place.org),
in addition to the full references for Binford (2001), Binford and Johnson (2006), and Kirby et al. (2016).

## Versions

See the [list of releases](https://github.com/D-PLACE/dplace-data/releases) for available released versions of D-PLACE data, and see the [changelog](https://github.com/D-PLACE/dplace-data/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the changes made in each version.

## Acknowledgements

D-PLACE would not exist without the cultural datasets upon which it relies; we would like
to acknowledge the years of work by George P. Murdock and Lewis R. Binford, and the
enormous contributions made by other scholars in the field towards their maintenance and
updating. 

Finally, a number of people provided assistance in preparing data for inclusion in D-PLACE,
including Christopher Blackford, Kaylin Clements, Anna Kellogg, Hannah Haynie, Patrick
Kavanagh, Ameena Khan, Beata Opalinska, Anum Rafiq, Anastasia Stellato, and George
Tsourounis.
