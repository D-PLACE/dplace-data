Data for [D-PLACE](https://d-place.org).

Research that uses data from D-PLACE should cite both the original source(s) of
the data and the paper by Kirby et al. in which D-PLACE was first presented
e.g., for research using cultural data from the Binford Hunter-Gatherer dataset:

    Binford (2001); Binford and Johnson (2006); Kirby et al. (2016).

The reference list should include the date the data were accessed and URL for [D-PLACE](https://d-place.org),
in addition to the full references for Binford (2001), Binford and Johnson (2006), and Kirby et al. (2016).
