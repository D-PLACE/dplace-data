# Changelog


## [1.1.1] - UNRELEASED

- Better handling of sources in bibTex format.
- Upgraded to Glottolog 4.2.1 #275.
- Correction to EA009 codes 5 and 6, for which the 'shortName' of the codes was reversed #286.
- Proper attribution and citation information for the GMTED2010 and ecoClimate datasets has
  been added.
- Corrected WNAI115 and WNAI65 codes.

### Society and Language Assignments

- Corrected mapping of "Tanggu" to "Tangga", thanks to Russell Barlow #282.
- Refined mapping for xd582 from the language family 'Ossetian' to the specific language Digor
  Ossetian (digo1242) #278.
- Refined the mapping for xd1396 to nort2971, as one of the sources (S.C.H. Hawtrey) worked in
  the departments of Boqueron and Presidente Hayes, with Boqueron being to the north of all of
  Glottolog's Lengua coordinates. Evidence is weak, but this is better than linking to the family
  level glottocode leng1262 #277.
- Added language mapping for D301_Kare #271.
- Remapped Ogaden Arabic to Standard Arabic (stan1318) #266.
- Updated various society mappings #244, #243, #245, #187, #183, #251
