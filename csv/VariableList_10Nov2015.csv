","Codes for ""first years"" in Murdock do not include options for Matrilocal/Patrilocal…it is not clear if these are contained in Uxorilocal/Virilocal. In the case of the ""Marital residence (prevailing pattern)"" variable Matrilocal/Patrilocal are distinguished by Uxorilocal/Virilocal (with the latter being ""confined to instances where the wife's [husband's] matrikin [patrikin] are not aggregated in matrilocal and matrilineal [patrilocal and matrilineal] kin groups"".
