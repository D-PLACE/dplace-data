Ethnographic Atlas,Kinship,10,Marital residence with kin: first years,"Pattern of marital residence in the first years or so of marriage. The variable ""Marital residence with kin: change after first years"" indicates whether or not this differs from the pattern of marital residence in later years.","Marriage, Kinship",Murdock 1962_1963,"Recoded to be a ""stand alone"" variable. Now, societies for which code was ""not different than later years"" have this information spelled out, using detailed codes of Gray's v12, which describes the pattern of marital residence in later years. Note also that two codes were added for ""Uv"" and ""Vu"" based on Murdock's note under the Ambilocal code. Specifically: ""The symbols Uv or Vu are used to denote, respectively, a marked preponderance of uxorilocal or virilocal practice [in ambilocal residence]. That is, cases of ambilocal residence where the actual frequency of uxorilocal vs. virilocal residence exceeds the other by a ratio greater than two to one. ","Codes for ""first years"" in Murdock do not include options for Matrilocal/Patrilocal…it is not clear if these are contained in Uxorilocal/Virilocal. In the case of the ""Marital residence (prevailing pattern)"" variable Matrilocal/Patrilocal are distinguished by Uxorilocal/Virilocal (with the latter being ""confined to instances where the wife's [husband's] matrikin [patrikin] are not aggregated in matrilocal and matrilineal [patrilocal and matrilineal] kin groups"". If coding differs for v10, is it misleading to adopt more detailed codes from v12? Should Matri/Uxori and Patri/Viri be grouped??"
