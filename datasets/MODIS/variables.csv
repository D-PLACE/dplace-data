NetPrimaryProductionConstancy,Ecology,Net primary production constancy,Colwell's (1974) information theoretic index. Indicates the extent to which a climate patterns are predictable because conditions are constant. Varies between 0 (completely unpredictable) and 1 (fully predictable).,Continuous,,Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer,,
NetPrimaryProductionContingency,Ecology,Net primary production contingency,Colwell's (1974) information theoretic index. Indicates the extent to which a climate patterns are predictable because conditions oscillate in a very predictable manner.

NetPrimaryProductionPredictability,Ecology,Net primary production predictability,Colwell's (1974) information theoretic index. Indicates the extent to which a climate patterns are predictable due to either constancy or contingency.  Varies between 0 (completely unpredictable) and 1 (fully predictable).,Continuous,,Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer,,
