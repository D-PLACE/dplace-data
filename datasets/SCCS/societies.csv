From White pinpointing sheets: ""The Pygmies and Pygmoid peoples of the Congo have been pushed into smaller and smaller areas of the tropical forest since the invasions of Bantu and Sudanic tribes in the 16-17th centuries, and most of the groups have adopted the languages of invading tribes with whom they allied themselves. Mbuti pygmies have adopted the languages of the Bira to the south of them, the Lese to the east, the Mangbetu and Azande to the northwest, and the Mamvu-Mangutu to the north. The [...] Epulu group studied by Turnbull situated to the north of the Ituri and Epulu Rivers, and the majority of the other groups to the south of the Ituri River [...] are net-hunters, and speak a language largely influenced by the Forest Bira."" Note, though, that Ember concordance lists the language as Lese."
