Armed combat, which is fighting with weapons, is performed by military organizations. When political communities within the same cultural unit engage in warfare, this is considered to be internal war. p. 143: If there is more than one military organization within a political community, and these ... engage in armed combat, this is considered feuding or civil war, depending on the scope of the conflict.

Otterbein made one useful distinction that I could not implement satisfactorily. He coded the military expectations in order of importance -- first, second, third.

Tests of ""Alternative Warfare Explanations"" (p. 881) included the use of a warfare mortality code by Ember and Ember (1983), and led to a compilation of internal and external warfare ratings by Keith Otterbein and Carol and Melvin Ember for societies in their samples that overlapped with the standard sample.  Annotations for locating the Embers' (and Otterbein's) codes are given in coding notes (STDS53.ANO).  White supplemented the codes on these variables by rating some of these same societies plus many others not rated by these other authors.  Reliabilities of the Ember's ratings were found to be high.
